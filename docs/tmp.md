I have a kinda hackish method for getting the server runtime enviornment variables on the client, that are in both of these files.

kessler/frontend/src/lib/env_variables_hydration_script.tsx
kessler/frontend/src/lib/env_variables_root_script.tsx

it does work, but I am needing to refactor this a bit to better support functions that need access to these variables on both the client and the server and I need good interfaces to support that, and thought it would be a good time to improve the architecture.

Throw any ideas for improvement in kessler/docs/frontend_env_refactor.md

# üåê Next.js Runtime Environment Configuration

**Effortlessly populate your environment at runtime, not just at build time, with `next-runtime-env`.**

üåü **Highlights:**
- **Isomorphic Design:** Works seamlessly on both server and browser, and even in middleware.
- **Next.js 13 & 14 Ready:** Fully compatible with the latest Next.js features.
- **`.env` Friendly:** Use `.env` files during development, just like standard Next.js.

### ü§î Why `next-runtime-env`?

In the modern software development landscape, the "[Build once, deploy many][build-once-deploy-many-link]" philosophy is key. This principle, essential for easy deployment and testability, is a [cornerstone of continuous delivery][fundamental-principle-link] and is embraced by the [twelve-factor methodology][twelve-factor-link]. However, front-end development, particularly with Next.js, often lacks support for this - requiring separate builds for different environments. `next-runtime-env` is our solution to bridge this gap in Next.js.

### üì¶ Introducing `next-runtime-env`

`next-runtime-env` dynamically injects environment variables into your Next.js application at runtime. This approach adheres to the "build once, deploy many" principle, allowing the same build to be used across various environments without rebuilds.

### ü§ù Compatibility Notes

- **Next.js 14:** Use `next-runtime-env@3.x` for optimal caching support.
- **Next.js 13:** Opt for [`next-runtime-env@2.x`][app-router-branch-link], tailored for the App Router.
- **Next.js 12/13 Page Router:** Stick with [`next-runtime-env@1.x`][pages-router-branch-link].

### üîñ Version Guide

- **1.x:** Next.js 12/13 Page Router
- **2.x:** Next.js 13 App Router
- **3.x:** Next.js 14 with advanced caching

### üöÄ Getting Started

In your `app/layout.tsx`, add:

```js
// app/layout.tsx
import { PublicEnvScript } from 'next-runtime-env';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <PublicEnvScript />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

The `PublicEnvScript` component automatically exposes all environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to the browser. For custom variable exposure, refer to [EXPOSING_CUSTOM_ENV.md](docs/EXPOSING_CUSTOM_ENV.md).

### üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Access your environment variables easily:

```tsx
// app/client-page.tsx
'use client';
import { env } from 'next-runtime-env';

export default function SomePage() {
  const NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO = env('NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO');
  return <main>NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO: {NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO}</main>;
}
```
