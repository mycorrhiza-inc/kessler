# Plans for the future of the globe platform.

## Datatypes

Battles - Fundamental Unit Type, Every Battle is has child battles, that are each battles occurring on a smaller more local level that are directly dependant for winning the parent battle. For one example, a chain might look like this.

Stoping New Fossil Fuel Development in the USA > Stopping the Uinta Basin Railway > Getting the Mayor of Greenwood Springs to publicly condem the project.

Battles with no children/"root battles" should ideally be similar to "SMART Goals", namely they should be narrow and well defined, with measurable outcomes for sucesss and where the next steps for any party are reasonable to find.

Each Battle should have the following attributes:

- Juristiction: The Geographical area of people that has immediate political power over, for battles with a clearly defined political boundary this can be defined as just said political boundary, however parent battles are likely to be a bit harder, maybe just unioning up the boundaries of the children could be a solution.

Boundaries also let you define some good metrics for individual effectiveness on a campaign, since the number of people in a juristiction is very loosely correlated with how much impact you could have as a citizen. And specifically if you are hunting for a campaign that will be maximally effective compared to resources invested will want a campaign where they are maxmially impactful, a campaign where victory and failure have comperable likelyhood, and is dispraportinately impactful to the broader cause.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
